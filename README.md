# Play_musical_notes_buzzer
Here I created a python code which will extract the musical notes and note duration from a music in MP3 format. It will be better if the music is monotonic. After getting the notes and note duration extracted in two seperate text file.Upload it to your micropython device like ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico. Or you can use it in arduino codes.
